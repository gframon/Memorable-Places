# Memorable-Places

A location app made in the Udemy iOS 10 course.  A very simple
map app in which a list of places (if any) is display and the 
user can click on one location and it's going to be displayed
on a map.  The user could add locations by a longpress on the 
map which will add the location to the list and this will be
stored in the UserDefaults.
